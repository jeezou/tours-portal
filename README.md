#### This repository was made according to a test assignment from [Magnat Professional](https://magnatmedia.com/) :computer:


The application is a service of domestic online tourism, including 3D, VR and Video tours

### Common requirements:
- Layouts of the pages mentioned in the task are placed in Figma by the link [layout](https://www.figma.com/file/xr5KMEXSBMDrzaxzU1Xzi0/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B5-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%A0%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8B?node-id=2%3A3)
- The work must be done under the Git version control system in a separate repository on GitHub from the beginning of the test task to the final version submitted for review. It is appropriate to perform both parts of the assignment in the same repository within one (master) branch
- It is advisable to complete the test task in the adaptive version, when the provided pages can be opened both on the computer and on a mobile device, without loss of information content and usability
- The use of libraries and frameworks is not limited
- All the results of the work must be presented first as source code in the Git repository and second, as a layout ready to be opened in a browser

### Main tasks
- #### Static error page layout. 
  - To solve the problem you need to design a static Error 404 page, the result of this part of the task must be a vue component that would run npm run serve and quietly open at localhost:<port>/error. We will use SCSS for styles

-  #### Preparing the main page (on '/' root):
   - It is necessary to make a "static" layout of the Home page.
   - Next, as part of the work on the page you need to "animate" the "Choose a virtual tour" block. Mechanism: A user clicks on any card, the card is turned and any content appears on it like a picture, title and button. The process of turning over must be animated.
   - The "Choose a Tour" block should easily move left to right with the cursor or a finger (in the mobile version). At the same time on the screen should not be present scroll bar of the block.
